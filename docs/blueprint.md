## Core Features:

- Phase Management: Allow users to create and manage phases with tasks and steps.
- Dependency Management: Enable task dependencies. Completion of prerequisite tasks enables other tasks.
- Overall Progress: Visually display project status, show tasks that are delayed, and estimate duration for project completion. The tool will use pattern-matching of tasks marked 'delayed' against completed tasks in order to refine its duration estimation algorithm.
- Duration Estimator: Suggest the user how to estimate duration of any steps/tasks based on type of them using a generative AI tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calming blue (#64B5F6) to promote trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7) for a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#9575CD) for CTAs and highlights.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for clear task and phase readability.
- Simple, intuitive icons for task and phase statuses (e.g., in progress, completed, delayed).
- Prioritize a dashboard layout for easy tracking of the project progress.
